# HELLO-WORLD
This is  my first depository
Well world, my name is Constantinos, 36 Cypriot and unemployed.
I was always facinated with what you can do with coding. I mean
you can teach your electronics do the thinking for you. So since
I got the time to spare, I decided to give it a go. I am here on 
a learning expedition.
